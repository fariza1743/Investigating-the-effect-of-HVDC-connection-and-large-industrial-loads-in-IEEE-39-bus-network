In this project we had to complete 5 tasks in total. The objectives of the tasks are to â€“ 
1. Perform load flow analysis of IEEE 39-Bus System. 
2. Find circuit breaker rating of all generator buses by performing symmetrical fault 
analysis. 
3. Observing change in fault current if photovoltaic generator is connected. 
4. Observe line overloading when an induction motor is connected. 
5. Finally design a solution to mitigate line overloading.
